# Meeting Notes

## TSC Chair Election

Ethan is chair by unanimous agreement by TSC members. 

## Discuss How We Document and Standardize OpenPubkey

RFC is a nice format, but there are concerns it is too formal to serve the community as a whole. 

The goal is to give the community a structured way to interact with the design of OPK rather than just the code. 

For now, we think a Markdown file in GitHub makes sense (within the `openpubkey/openpubkey` repo) so folks can make PRs against it. We would like to adopt the RFC that defines usage of "must," "should," and "may." Diagrams in Markdown can use Mermaid or if a more complex diagram is necessary, can always embed an image. 

Ethan is taking an [action item](#action-items) to draft this proposal up to discuss in the next community meeting. 

## Ownership of Non-Core OpenPubkey Repositories

The repositories will remain in the OPK repository for now. 

## Standardizing Admin/Write Access to Repositories

The desire is for all members of the TSC to have admin/write access to the OpenPubkey repositories. 

Rather than fight with group permissions, Ethan changed all members of TSC to owners of OpenPubkey. They agreed they will not make org-level changes without making the other members aware and making sure there is agreement.

# Action Items

1. Ethan to put a proposal together for how to document and standardize OpenPubkey. He will share it with community and discuss this at the next community meeting.
