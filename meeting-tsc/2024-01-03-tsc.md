# Meeting Notes

## License Header

* For reference: [issue 82 in OPK repo](https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/issues/82).
* Discussion around if the copyright holder would be OpenPubkey.
* Conclusion is yes based on some similarly licensed open source projects we reviewed.
* We should also include the license identifier in our source code files: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
* If still in doubt, we will reach out to LF to confirm the right copyright information.


## Update to README

* Ann to put up a README update in GitHub.
* This will include a new FAQ page that links to the wiki for [OPK additional reading](https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/wiki/OpenPubkey-Reading-List).
