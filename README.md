# Project Governance

OpenPubkey is governed by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). This group is responsible for the technical oversight of OpenPubkey, which may include the following:
 1. Coordinating the technical direction of OpenPubkey
 2. Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope)
 3. Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects
 4. Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements
 5. Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities
 6. Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies
 7. Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing
 8. Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects
 9. Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding OpenPubkey

## Current Members of the TSC
