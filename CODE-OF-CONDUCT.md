# OpenPubkey Community Code of Conduct

OpenPubkey follows the [GitHub Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct). 

We'd notably like to call out GitHub's [pledge](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct#pledge):

> In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in GitHub Community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Abuse, harrassment, or other unacceptable behavior that violates the above pledge will not be tolerated. Should it be needed, please report issues to conduct@bastionzero.com.
